# Max's Dotfiles ðŸ’¾

![neofetch screenshot](neofetch.png)

These are my dotfiles. They are customizable and can be deployed on different devices, thanks to their modular nature and the use of templating.

Also check out [ricecooker](https://github.com/maxadamski/ricecooker), my project I used to make these.
